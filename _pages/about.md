I am Research Professor at ICREA, and affiliated with University of Lleida.
Before joining ICREA, I was Research Director (Directeur de Recherche) at [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/) (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), affiliated with [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse), [Toulouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) and principal researcher of [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/)'s Chair on [Deep Learner Explanation and Verification](https://anitideeplever.laas.fr) ([DeepLEVER](https://anitideeplever.laas.fr)) (the team's publications are available [here](https://anitideeplever.laas.fr/publications)).  Before joining IRIT/CNRS & ANITI, I was affiliated, as Professor of Computer Science, with [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) (IE), the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) (UK), and the [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/) (PT). I received the PhD from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), Ann Arbor (USA). My research interests include automated reasoning, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
